# Installing Anaconda or Miniconda on Ubuntu:

## Step 1: Update and download wget

- Update OS:
  ```shell
  sudo apt-get update
  ```
- Move to the /tmp directory:
  ```shell
  cd /tmp
  ```
- Install the wget command:
  ```shell
  apt-get install wget
  ```

## Step 2: Install Anaconda or Miniconda

### Install Anaconda

- Download the Anaconda installer - check version here [Anaconda](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/):
  ```shell
  https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/
  ```
- Once the download is complete, verify the hash code integrity of the package:
  ```shell
  sha256sum Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh
  ```
- The output will notify if any errors occurred. If there are no errors, move on to the actual installation step. To continue, run the Anaconda bash shell script:
  ```shell
  bash Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh
  ```

### Install Miniconda - use the following commands consecutively

```shell
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

```shell
sha256sum Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

```shell
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

## Step 3: Test the Connection

- With the installation done, the next step is to activate the added environment settings using the following command:
  ```shell
  source ~/.bashrc
  ```
- Then, test out the connection:
  ```shell
  conda info
  ```

## Uninstalling Anaconda

- In order to uninstall Anaconda, install the following anaconda-clean package:
